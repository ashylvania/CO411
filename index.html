            <p>Congratulations on your upcoming trip to Denver, Colorado! Nicknamed “The Mile High City” not only because it was the first city to legalize recreational cannabis but because the elevation is one mile above sea level (5,279 ft)! Roughly the same elevation as Truckee, California.

               <br> 
               Since you will be making a sudden change in altitude (flying) instead of a steady climb (driving) there are a few things to keep in mind. Make sure you are properly hydrated and eat frequently to avoid altitude sickness (<b>TRUST ME</b>, I have had it <b>twice</b> and it WILL ruin your trip). Many athletes come here to train to help build endurance but this is just a leisurely visit so we want to make sure you're feeling good the whole time! </p>

    <div class="about-container">
        <p>Denver became a city in 1860, a whole ass 16 years before Colorado entered the union. Colorado is also known as "The Centennial State". It got the nickname because it became a state in 1876, 100 years after the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Denver City was a frontier town, with an economy based on servicing local miners with gambling, saloons, livestock and goods trading. Old Colorado was proper cowboy country and Buffalo Bill is buried just outside of Denver.

            Old Colorado may conjure visions of classic Hollywood westerns but modern Denver is pretty liberal. Our governor, Jared Polis, was the first openly gay governor in history. The Denver City Council honors and acknowledges that the land on which we reside is the traditional territory of the Ute, Cheyenne, and Arapaho Peoples.</p>

            <p>Denver International Airport (DIA) is the largest airport in North America and the second largest in the world. DIA replaced Stapleton Airport on February 28, 1995, 16 months behind schedule and at a cost of $4.8 billion (equivalent to $8.2 billion today).</p>

        <div class="dia-gargoyle">
            <p>In March 2019, the airport unveiled an animated, talking gargoyle in the middle of one of the concourses. The gargoyle interacts with passengers and jokes about the supposed conspiracies connected to the airport</p>

            <p>You don’t have to dig too deep online to find some truly wild conspiracy theories about DIA. Save yourself from the tinfoil hat content and just know that DIA is combatting this narrative with humor. There has been a decent amount of construction the last few years and DIA has placed these hilarious privacy walls to “troll” any big-brained travelers.</p>

            <p>Now, for my favorite part of DIA. "Blue Mustang", by El Paso-born artist Luis Jiménez, was one of the earliest public art commissions for DIA in 1993. The 32-foot-tall sculpture is a bright blue cast-fiberglass sculpture of a horse with glowing red eyes located between the inbound and outbound lanes of Peña Boulevard. Jiménez was killed while creating the sculpture when a part of it fell on him. The statue has been the subject of considerable controversy, and has acquired the nickname "Blucifer" for its demonic appearance.</p>

        <p>To say that Denver weather is temperamental would be an understatement. I truly hope you dont have to experience the colder option in terms of potential extremes but here is a handy guide of historic highs and lows. So, it would be safe to say that we will have temps that fall somewhere in between these ranges. Unless of course we're going for a new record. I will be in contact with you closer to your departure date. Worst case scenario we can get swing by my work and set you up with some winter gear. </p>

    <br>
    <div class="restaurant-container">
        <h4 class="restaurant-category">Breakfast, Brunch, and Lunch</h4>
        <br>
        <p class="restaurant-item"><a href="https://www.steubens.com/uptown-menu/" target="_blank">Steuben's</a></p>
        <p class="restaurant-bio">The best all-around option. A beloved Denver staple that is great for any meal but ESPECIALLY brunch!  
            <br>
            <br>
        &hearts; My "go to" order: Biscuits and gravy or philly cheesesteak</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="restaurant-item"><a href="https://www.denbisco.com/menu-1" target="_blank">Denver Biscuit Company</a></p>
        <p class="restaurant-bio">If you're in the mood for biscuits and gravy with a side of afternoon coma, then this is the spot!
            <br>
            <br>
        &hearts; My "go to" order: Classic biscuit and gravy with an added fried egg</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="restaurant-item"><a href="https://syruprestaurant.com/breakfast" target="_blank">Syrup</a></p>
        <p class="restaurant-bio">Technically walking distance spot overlooking City Park. Closes early so it can get pretty busy.  A solid third choice.
            <br>

        <p class="restaurant-bio">The most pretentious of the four other options. Their specialty is their long outdoor line that creates more of a buzz than the food itself. Not bad by any means but you may have to throw some elbows to get in.
            <br>
            <br>
        &hearts; My "go to" order: French toast or breakfast sandwhich</p>

        <p class="restaurant-bio">Despite being land-locked, it is possible to get some quality seafood options out here. Corner is great for ramen and poke!
            <br>
            <br>
        &hearts; My "go to" order: Deep fried shrimp poke bowl or lobster ramen if I'm feeling rich</p>

    <!--SUMMARY-OUTRO-->
    <h3 class="section-title">Rocky Mountain High</h3>
    <div class="outro-image-one"></div>
    <div class="outro-summary">During your visit you may see many bumper stickers that resemble the Colorado license plate with the word "NATIVE" printed inside. This is a badge of honor for those born and raised here. While I will never be able to claim this for myself, I am honored to hold the title of "local". 
        Denver is a rich, diverse city full of culture reminiscent of someplace in the Bay Area. As though it was plucked from the coast and set down at the eastern foothills of the Rockies. 
        <div class="outro-image-two"></div>
        Denver was a well kept secret for many years but she's growing rapidly. Much like the Colorado Gold Rush of 1858, there are people coming from all over the country to set down their roots. Colorado's population grew at nearly twice the rate of the rest of the nation between 2010 and 2020. 
        <div class="outro-image-three"></div>
        Colorado has such sights to show you! There are dozens upon dozens of wonders even I have yet to experience. We are excited to share the city with you. I love Colorado and I hope you will too!</div>
